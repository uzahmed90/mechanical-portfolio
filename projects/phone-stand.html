    <h1>3D Printed Phone Stand</h1>
    <p><strong>Tools</strong> Autodesk Inventor, MakerBot 3D printer</p>
    <p><strong>Role</strong> Individual project</p>

    <h2>Project overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project is a custom phone stand that I designed and modeled in Autodesk Inventor, 
      then manufactured using a MakerBot 3D printer. The goal was to create a compact stand 
      that supports the phone at a comfortable viewing angle while remaining stable during use.
    </p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Support a smartphone in landscape and portrait orientation.</li>
      <li>Keep the design simple enough to print without supports on the 3D printer.</li>
      <li>Provide enough strength and stiffness for everyday use on a desk or nightstand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design process</h2>
    <h3>Concept and requirements</h3>
    <p>
      I began by listing basic requirements such as minimum opening width for the phone, 
      target viewing angle. From there I sketched several possible profiles 
      for the stand and selected a design that balanced stability and printability.
    </p>

    <h3>CAD modeling in Autodesk Inventor</h3>
    <p>
      I created the main geometry as a parametric part in Autodesk Inventor. 
      Key dimensions such as phone thickness, height of the support surface, 
      and base length were defined with parameters so they could be adjusted easily in future iterations.
    </p>

    <h3>3D printing considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oriented the part so that the layers run in a way that supports bending loads on the stand.</li>
      <li>Chose layer height, infill percentage, and wall thickness to balance strength and print time.</li>
      <li>Added small fillets at high stress corners to reduce stress concentration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
      The final print met the design goals. The stand holds the phone securely and is comfortable 
      for watching videos or checking notifications. If I rework on the design, I plan to test 
      different angles and add a soft contact surface to protect the phone finish.
      I would also cut holes out to include a charging port.

    <h2>3D model viewer</h2>
    <p>
      A live 3D view of the Inventor model will appear here once the STL file is uploaded. 
      This section will allow reviewers to orbit and inspect the stand geometry directly in the browser.
    </p>

    <!-- 3D viewer placeholder  we will wire this up after you upload the STL file -->
    <div id="viewer" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; border: 1px solid #ddd; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
      <p>3D viewer coming soon.</p>
    </div>
